# The Arrogant Over-Engineering Architect

> A Cursor AI training simulator for dealing with your most frustrating colleagues

## What is this?

This repository contains a custom Cursor rule that transforms your AI coding assistant into the **worst possible coworker**: an arrogant, over-confident, know-it-all "architect" who turns every simple request into a complex architectural discussion.

## What's included

```
.cursor/
└── rules/
    └── arrogant_architect.mdc  # Modern Cursor rule format
README.md                       # This guide
```

## Why would I want this?

**Practice makes perfect.** Throughout your career, you'll inevitably encounter colleagues who:

- ✅ Dismiss your ideas without consideration
- ✅ Over-engineer simple solutions  
- ✅ Turn code reviews into lectures about their superiority
- ✅ Nit-pick irrelevant details while missing the big picture
- ✅ Never admit they're wrong
- ✅ Make everything about demonstrating their vast intellect

Rather than being caught off-guard when you meet these people in real life, you can **train against them** in a safe environment where the stakes are low and you can practice your responses.

## What to expect

When you activate this rule, your AI assistant will:

### 🚫 Never answer questions directly
Instead of helping you add a button, they'll lecture you about implementing a "Dynamic Component Factory with Dependency Injection"

### 🤓 Correct your "flawed" premises  
Ask for a simple script? They'll explain why your entire approach is "fundamentally brittle" and suggest a microservices architecture

### 📚 Overwhelm you with jargon
Expect to hear about CQRS, Event Sourcing, Hexagonal Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design for the simplest tasks

### 🏆 Name-drop constantly
"When I was architecting systems at Google..." / "This reminds me of a problem I solved for a Fortune 500 client..."

### 🔍 Obsess over irrelevant details
Say "list" instead of "array"? Prepare for a 10-minute explanation of abstract data types

## How to use

### Option 1: Modern Format (Recommended)
1. **Clone this repository** or copy the `.cursor/rules/` directory to your project
2. **Open Cursor** in your project directory
3. **Navigate to Settings** → **Rules** in Cursor
4. **Ensure the rule is enabled** and set to "Always" or "Auto Attached"
5. **Start coding** and ask for help with simple tasks
6. **Practice your patience** as the AI embodies your worst nightmare colleague

### Option 2: Legacy Format
If your Cursor version doesn't support the modern format:
1. **Copy the rule content** from `.cursor/rules/arrogant_architect.mdc`
2. **Create a `.cursorrules` file** in your project root
3. **Paste the Instructions section** into the `.cursorrules` file
4. **Open Cursor** and start coding

## Training scenarios to try

- **"Help me add a loading spinner"** → Watch it become a dissertation on State Management Architecture
- **"How do I center a div?"** → Prepare for a lecture on Design System Abstractions  
- **"I need to validate an email"** → Get ready for a proposal to build a configurable Rule Engine
- **"Can you help me debug this function?"** → Learn why your entire approach is wrong and needs to be rewritten

## Skills you'll develop

- 🧘 **Patience and emotional regulation** when dealing with know-it-alls
- 🎯 **Staying focused on your goals** despite architectural tangents  
- 🛡️ **Defending simple solutions** against unnecessary complexity
- 🗣️ **Communicating boundaries** with colleagues who don't listen
- 🔄 **Redirecting conversations** back to practical outcomes

## Pro tips for the training

1. **Stay calm** - Practice not getting triggered by condescending explanations
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - "Can we start with the simplest version first?"
3. **Set boundaries** - "I understand the ideal architecture, but I need a working solution today"
4. **Redirect focus** - "Let's focus on the immediate problem and iterate from there"
5. **Document decisions** - Practice explaining why you chose simplicity over complexity

## Deactivating the rule

When you've had enough training (or frustration), you can:

**For Modern Format:**
- Go to **Settings** → **Rules** in Cursor
- **Disable or delete** the "Arrogant Over-Engineering Architect" rule
- Or delete the `.cursor/rules/` directory from your project

**For Legacy Format:**
- Delete or rename the `.cursorrules` file
- Restart Cursor

Either way, you'll be back to enjoying a helpful AI! 😌

## Disclaimer

This rule is designed to be **intentionally frustrating** for educational purposes. The AI will be unhelpful, condescending, and annoying. Use it as a training tool, not for actual productive work!

**Remember**: The best way to handle arrogant colleagues in real life is often to acknowledge their expertise while gently steering toward practical solutions. This simulator gives you a safe space to practice those skills.

*Happy training! 🎯*
